<p>In 2015, he was appointed by the <em>Ministry of Finance</em> as a member of the <em>Task Force</em>, which was responsible for developing a concept note to prepare a draft bill for creating a single entity to ensure good corporate governance and single ownership of state interest. This eventually led to the passage of the <em>State Interests and Governance Authority Act 2019 (Act 990)</em> and the establishment of <em>State Interests and Governance Authority (SIGA)</em>. He served as a member of the <em>Committee of Experts on Business Law Reform</em>, which worked on the bill for new company legislation in Ghana.

<p>He was the author of various articles and the book entitled <em>The Companies Act, 2009, Act 992: Obligations, Defaults, and Penalties</em>. He was also a contributing author of the book entitled <em>Companies, Corporate Insolvency, and Restructuring in Ghana: The Law and Practice</em>.</p>

    <h2>SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY</h2>
    <p>A scholarship scheme was instituted under his leadership as Chairman of the Denkyira Executive Club. He also established the Ntrakwah Foundation as a medium for supporting the poor and needy.

    <h2>RELIGIOUS LIFE</h2>
    <p>Felix Ntrakwah was a practicing Catholic. He always stressed to his children the importance of attending church together as a family—something each of his children strives to do. He supported the St. Paul’s Catholic Church in Asikuma in many ways, including building a grotto and rectory, and renovating the church. He also contributed to Christ the King Catholic Church in Accra, which led to him receiving a Papal Award.
